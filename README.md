Python is a powerful high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum.

It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time.

Wes McKinney, author of the pandas library, excerpted from Quora:

<small>
"Python's popularity for data science is largely due to the <b>strength of its core libraries (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, IPython)</b>, <b>high productivity for prototyping and building small and reusable systems</b>, and its <b>strength as a general purpose programming language</b>. Since data scientists are also often involved with wiring together network applications, programming for the web, scripting and automating data processing jobs and other processes, and lots of ad hoc data munging (the kind of stuff people loved using Perl for in the 90s), it's very desirable to be able to do all these things, in addition to the actual analysis and modeling, in a single language. Python also excels as a glue language for applications written in C, C++, and Fortran, especially using the excellent Cython [5] project. <b>Typically only a small part of an application you build will be slow</b> (call it a 90/10 or 95/5 rule); by using Python you can build a program very quickly, profile and identify bottlenecks, then optimize by using better array programming techniques or, <b>if necessary, reimplementing the bottlenecks in Cython or C/Fortran.</b>"
